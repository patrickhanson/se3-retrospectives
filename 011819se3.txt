What was good:
-early course material, good on pacing, helpful materials
-lesson material up to Node good


What was bad:
-current course material, lessons/links not very helpful (node, http clients)
-Intro to Modules, Comparison to Node HTTP Clients (little instruction, little material, confusing)
-Promises?
-old material released to self paced students



Suggestions for improvement:
-need a more technical breakdown on Node, what's each specific component and how they work together
-share supplemental materials with the rest of the class
-lesson on Google searching, finding answers on the internet
-lesson on project architecture, best practices
-examples on best practices on different assessments
